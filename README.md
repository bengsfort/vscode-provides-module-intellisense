# provides-module-intellisense

## Features

Adds `@providesModule` intellisense to `import from` statements in javascript projects. Will cache modules on activation, but you can manually run the module caching via the command drawer:

```
> cmd + shift + p
> Cache Modules
```

Modules are also re-cached every time they are changed.

## @todo

- add support for named export module predictions
- add unit tests
- clean up source
